    <h1>Programming Quotes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</li>
        <li>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</li>
        <li>I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.</li>
        <li>Truth can only be found in one place: the code.</li>
        <li>Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day.
            Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.</li>
    </ul>
